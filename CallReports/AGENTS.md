Every document uploaded in this /CallReports/ folder will have the same format and fields. Make sure we have the documentation to pull the data from them and format them as needed. This is intended to be a tool for a site on the dashboard called "Prospects" where we are able to see the relevant data for our niche that can be pulled from the call report. Please update this file with more information as it becomes more relevant and built out.

  ],
  "insights": [
    "Vehicle lending of $50.5M in new and used autos plus $11.8M in other secured loans carries $114k of charge-offs year-to-dateâ€”ideal for bundling payment protection, GAP, and VSC coverage.",
    "1,072 loans totaling $26.2M originated year-to-date create a steady pipeline to package protection products at the point of sale.",
    "Thirty-seven troubled debt restructures with $787k outstanding highlight members who would benefit from payment protection to stabilize reworked loans."

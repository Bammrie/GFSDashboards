  "insights": [
    "Vehicle lending totals $46.4M across new, used, and leases—packaging GAP, VSC, and payment protection can blunt the recurring auto losses.",
    "703 loans and $15.3M booked year-to-date create steady touchpoints to enroll members in protection plans at origination.",
    "Card and signature balances with $63k of 60+ delinquency need debt protection to stabilize payments and keep losses from eroding margin."

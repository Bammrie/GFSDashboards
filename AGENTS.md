This is a dashboard for a company looking to see stats on how well a lending instituition(credit union) does on covering their loans with protection.

Each credit union must have a database of loan data that can be updated by manual entry or via API.
In the set up of a credit union, it must choose if it is either
  Credit Insurance (Single & Joint Rates)
    Must provide a "rate" for Single Life
    Must provide a "rate" for Joint Life
    Must provide a "rate" for Single Disability
    Must provide a "rate" for Joint Disability
  Credit Insurance (Blended Rates)
    Must provide a "rate" for Blended Life
    Must provide a "rate' for Blended Disability
  Debt Protection(Blended Rates)
    Must provide a "rate" for Package A
    Must provide a "rate" for Package B
    Must provide a "rate" for Package C

    Once created, each credit union will have a database of loans that include "Loan Date" "Loan Amount" "Loan Officer" and a Yes/No designation for if it received the coverage.

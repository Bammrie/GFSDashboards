REMINDER COMMAND: After every website request/PR, run `nano AGENTS.md` and log what was created and why it was created so the history is preserved.
2026-12-28: Parsed six newly uploaded call reports for Ascension, EFCU Financial, Gulf Coast, Maple, Rave Financial, and TLC Community; moved PDFs into CallReports and generated JSON plus prospect detail pages.


2025-10-26: Expanded the reporting layout for wider desktop screens, increased panel breathing room, and kept table labels on a single line so the summary reads cleanly.

2026-12-27: Added overflow handling to prospect metric cards so large formatted numbers wrap within their tiles.

2026-12-26: Fixed a nullish coalescing / logical OR mix-up in script.js so the Financial Center First prospect page renders metrics again and regenerated the static prospect bundles.

2026-12-24: Enabled automatic GitHub Pages provisioning in the deployment workflow by passing `enablement: true` to the configure-pages action to resolve the job failure when the site was not already set up.

2026-12-23: Uploaded a structured JSON extract for Financial Center First's June 2025 call report and regenerated the static prospect artifacts so Accounts and Prospects repopulate with full metrics again.
2026-12-22: Recreated the CallReports workspace with the June 2025 Financial Center First PDF and regenerated prospect artifacts so placeholder accounts build automatically from uploads.
2026-12-21: Parsed six newly uploaded CallReports PDFs into structured JSON, regenerated prospects-data bundles, and added risk/insight narratives so dashboards render full analytics for Ascension, EFCU Financial, Financial Center First, Gulf, Maple, and Rave Financial.

2026-12-20: Added the configure-pages step to the deployment workflow so GitHub Actions can enable Pages deployments without manual settings changes.

2026-12-19: Renamed newly added call report PDFs to slugified year/quarter filenames and taught the prospect generator to publish the synced `prospect-data.js` bundle alongside `prospects-data.json` so the frontend can read the refreshed prospect list without manual copying.

2025-01-14: Added channel exposure tables (indirect production and delinquency source mix) to the Prospects analytics experience, tying Inspire FCU (6/30/25) and Lion's Share FCU (9/30/23) call reports to revenue modeling.
2025-01-13: Launched the Prospects page with structured call-report analytics, revenue modeling for protection products, and a manual engagement log tied to parsed 5300 datasets.

This is a dashboard for a company looking to see stats on how well a lending instituition(credit union) does on covering their loans with protection.

Each credit union must have a database of loan data that can be updated by manual entry or via API.

In the set up of a credit union, it must choose if it is either
  Credit Insurance (Single & Joint Rates)
    Must provide a "rate" for Single Life
    Must provide a "rate" for Joint Life
    Must provide a "rate" for Single Disability
    Must provide a "rate" for Joint Disability
  Credit Insurance (Blended Rates)
    Must provide a "rate" for Blended Life
    Must provide a "rate' for Blended Disability
  Debt Protection(Blended Rates)
    Must provide a "rate" for Package A
    Must provide a "rate" for Package B
    Must provide a "rate" for Package C

    Once created, each credit union will have a database of loans that include "Loan Date" "Loan Amount" "Loan Officer" and a Yes/No designation for if it received the coverage.

## Coverage math reference (MOB, premiums, and penetration)
Keep the following formulas and terminology consistent everywhere the data platform performs calculations:

### Monthly Outstanding Balance (MOB)
* **Beginning balance (B<sub>m</sub>)**: outstanding principal at the start of month *m*.
* **Principal reduction (P<sub>m</sub>)**: total principal paid during month *m*.
* **Ending balance (E<sub>m</sub>)**: B<sub>m</sub> − P<sub>m</sub>.
* **Average MOB (\bar{B}<sub>m</sub>)**: (B<sub>m</sub> + E<sub>m</sub>) ÷ 2. Use \bar{B}<sub>m</sub> whenever the rate is quoted “per $100 of outstanding balance per month.”


### MOB rate component tracking
Whenever a Monthly Outstanding Balance rate is recorded (credit life, disability, or debt protection), capture all three parts separately:
* **CLP rate** – the carrier-provided base cost per $1,000 of outstanding balance.
* **GFS mark-up** – the Goodwine Financial Services commission added to the CLP rate.
* **Credit union mark-up** – the partner's income share layered on top of the GFS mark-up.
Store and report on each slice so premium remittance can be reconciled to its destination at month end.

### Credit Insurance (Life & Disability)
* Premium rate inputs are stored as *per $100 MOB* values. For a given month *m* and coverage type *c* (Single Life, Joint Life, etc.):
  * **Monthly premium** = (\bar{B}<sub>m</sub> ÷ 100) × rate<sub>c</sub>.
  * **Earned premium** = sum of the monthly premiums over the reporting window.
* **Penetration** for coverage *c* = (# of loans with coverage *c*) ÷ (total # of eligible loans).
* **Coverage ratio (Life)** = insured MOB ÷ total MOB (same month & population).
* Disability payouts rely on the covered monthly payment. Track the scheduled monthly payment (principal + interest) per loan to support claim analytics.

### Debt Protection (Packages A–C)
* Packages use blended life/disability benefits. Each package has its own rate<sub>p</sub> (per $100 MOB).
* For loan *i* in month *m* with package *p*:
  * **Monthly charge** = (\bar{B}<sub>m,i</sub> ÷ 100) × rate<sub>p</sub>.
* Penetration and coverage ratio mirror the credit insurance definitions, but are tracked separately per package.

### Prospect opportunity heuristics (credit insurance & debt protection)
* When modeling **Credit Life**, **Credit Disability**, or **Debt Protection / IUI** performance for call-report prospects:
  * **Monthly full-coverage premium** = (total consumer loans ÷ $1,000) × rate, where Life = $1.00, Disability = $2.25, IUI = $1.40 per $1,000.
  * **Modeled penetration** = 38%. Multiply the full-coverage premium by 0.38 to estimate the monthly remittance the credit union would see.
  * Current tables focus on the credit union share; GFS income is set to zero until markup guidance is provided.
* **Vehicle Service Contracts (VSC)** and **GAP** opportunities are estimated from direct auto production:
  * **Direct auto loans outstanding** = (new auto count + used auto count) − indirect auto count (never below zero).
  * **Monthly direct originations** = direct auto loans outstanding ÷ 24 (average term).
  * Apply 40% penetration with a $400 GFS margin for VSC and 70% penetration with a $50 GFS margin for GAP to forecast income.
  * Credit union income inputs remain zero until partner markups are defined.

### Ancillary products
* **GAP** – Treat as a per-loan flat premium. Store the amount sold (flat fee) and financed amount. Penetration = # GAP contracts ÷ # eligible auto loans. Loss ratio = claims paid ÷ GAP premium.
* **VSC** – Service contracts typically have tiered pricing. Store contract price, term, and vehicle mileage to support future analytics. Penetration = # VSC contracts ÷ # eligible vehicle loans.
* **Collateral Protection Insurance (CPI)** – Capture force-placed premium billed per loan and any cancellations. Coverage ratio = CPI loans ÷ total secured loans.
* **Fidelity Bond** – Track coverage limit, annual premium, and effective dates for reporting. Penetration measured at institution level (bond in force vs. total partners).

### Common metrics
* **Attachment rate (per product)** = insured loan count ÷ total loans (filtered by eligibility rules).
* **Premium per loan** = total premium ÷ insured loan count.
* **Claims ratio** = claims paid ÷ earned premium (when claim data is available).

Document or extend new features so they reuse these formulas without re-defining them.
